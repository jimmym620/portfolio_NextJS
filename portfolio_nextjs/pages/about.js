                <p>
                    Graduated from Heriot-Watt University in BSc Computer
                    Science in 2021.

                    After learning Web Dev technologies online, I have been
                    working on projects to test my knowledge and show off what I
                    have learned in this portfolio. My goal is to become a
                    software engineer and I will be keeping track of my progress
                    and experience on this site.
